Some examples of using UniFeat as a java library in your project have been provided.

In each folder, there are two versions of a feature selection method:
- `MethodNameDataset.java`: If only one dataset file is available, you can easily import this code.

See Section 6 of the [user manual](https://unifeat.github.io/docs/user_manual_v1.0.pdf) for more details.
